13862,251,Songhai,Korea,We report the Koreans to be pursuing cultural dominance presently
13863,251,Songhai,Korea,Our intelligence officers are not very certain in this estimate

13865,251,Songhai,Korea,The Incas imagine the prospect of taking over the Koreans to be average
13866,251,Songhai,Korea,A friendly posture with the Koreans is what we declare
13867,251,Songhai,Korea,Whatever the Koreans announced posture may be we see the Koreans as a favorable nation

21907,393,Songhai,Korea,Recent reports have led us to esteem the Koreans as a pathetic military actor
21908,393,Songhai,Korea,The Germans ministers of late acknowledge the Moroccans as an enemy
21909,393,Songhai,Korea,We figure the Koreans to be a bad target for attack
21910,393,Songhai,Korea,We report the Koreans to be pursuing diplomatic dominance currently

21917,393,The Incas,Morocco,According to the Koreans sources the Moroccans are focused on diplomatic preeminence
21918,393,The Incas,Morocco,This hypothesis comes from a not very convinced source
21919,393,The Incas,Morocco,A friend is how our spies described their dealings with the Moroccans
21920,393,The Incas,Morocco,We estimate that the Moroccans are a major problem to our interests

21930,393,Korea,Songhai,Whatever the Songhais public attitude may be the Germans acknowledge the Songhai as an archnemesis
21931,393,Korea,Songhai,We are regularly reminded by the Songhais behavior why we call the Songhai an enemy

22206,400,Songhai,Korea,We are periodically reminded by the Koreans behavior why we call the Koreans an enemy
22207,400,Songhai,Korea,Recent events have led us to consider the Koreans as a pathetic military contender
22208,400,Songhai,Korea,We esteem the likelihood of forcefully dominating the Koreans to be bad
